# 
the link for the .zip containing the .sln and .suo files will be updated at the end of every british day :D
# how to use
Download the files and the .sln and .suo file and make a new folder.
#
In that new folder make a new folder named 'Voxl' (without single qoute)
#
In the folder you just created ('Voxl') put all the files in EXCEPT the .sln and .suo files.
#
Extract the zip for the .sln and .suo files and put them in the first folder you made.
#
It should look something like this.
